<h2><small>BY WILLIAM P. SALTON</small></h2></div></div>

<div class="bk4"><p><i><big>It was a new time and a vast new war of complete and
awful annihilation. Yet, some things never change,
and, as in ancient times, Ulysses walked again&mdash;brave
and unconquerable&mdash;and again, the sirens wove
their deadly spell with a smile and a song.</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> came like monsters, rather
than men, into the vast ruin
of what had once been a great
city. They walked carefully, side
by side, speaking to each other by
radio as though they were in deep
space rather than upon solid
ground.</p>

<p>The winding way they followed
through the ruins was marked by
blurred footsteps in the dust and
the two men, clumsy in their
bulky suits, found the going difficult.</p>

<p>They stopped, and one of them
held out an instrument. He studied
the dial. "All clear," and both
men removed their helmets. They
wiped sweat from their faces and
glanced at each other.</p>

<p>The blonde man said, "The
air's okay, Jarvis. Everything
seems all right. I don't get it."</p>

<p>Jarvis, his dark eyes wary,
scowled as he looked about. "It
seems all right. But we know it
isn't. It can't be."</p>

<p>"I'm shucking this suit."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Mark!"</p>

<p>"But the dial read <i>clear</i>, man!
And we know nobody is going
to shoot us. All life <i>had</i> to be
wiped out."</p>

<p>"How about minor power installations?"</p>

<p>Jarvis took a chocolate bar
from his pocket, sat down on a
piece of broken rubble and began
to eat. "You're too careless&mdash;far
too careless, Mark."</p>

<p>Mark laughed. "You've always
been cautious enough for both of
us. Got me out of plenty of scrapes
back in school, too. Don't think
I've forgotten." Affection warmed
his blue eyes as they rested on the
face of his friend.</p>

<p>"Okay! Okay! But what happened
to them? Where did they
go?" Jarvis took nervous bites
from his second chocolate bar.
Then he, too, peeled off his suit.
He sniffed the air distrustfully, as
he wiggled his shoulders to free
them from the clinging, damp
shirt. Then he took a few experimental
steps forward.</p>

<p>"Seems all right, Mark. But
how do you explain about Hank
and Garland? Never were two
more careful guys."</p>

<p>"Probably a simple miscalculation.
Or an accident. We know it
couldn't have been enemy action.
Tests prove conclusively that we
wiped them out&mdash;to a man."
He took deep gulps of air into his
lungs, and stretched like a cat.
"We'll find out soon enough. Boy,
I feel great!"</p>

<hr />

<p>They deflated and folded their
safety suits and added the bundles
to the other equipment on their
backs. Then, with their instruments
held before them, they
probed their way into the twisted
wreckage, still following the faint,
dust-filled footprints.</p>

<p>Bent and rusted girders rose on
all sides like the bones of prehistoric
monsters. Nothing stirred.
The dust lay ages-thick on everything.</p>

<p>"Gives you the spooks, doesn't
it?" Jarvis was still tense, poised
to respond to the first signal of
danger. "Feels like we're the last
men alive!"</p>

<p>"Funny about Hank and Garland.
There's nothing here to
harm anyone."</p>

<p>Jarvis looked at his watch.
"Better contact HQ for instructions."</p>

<p>The two stepped off the path,
into the shade of a grotesque
chunk of broken masonry. Mark
set up the radio and twirled the
dials. "Team Four, calling HQ.
Team Four, reporting!"</p>

<p>"HQ here." The voice from the
radio blared loud in the stillness.
"Give your report, Team Four."</p>

<p>"Looks like nothing's moved
here in a thousand years. Safe as
a baby's dream. Rock-solid, air
morning-pure. But&mdash;" He hesitated,
trying not to sound like a
scared school boy. "No sign of
Team Three. Or of Teams One
and Two, either. Over."</p>

<p>"Look here, Team Four. It's
your job to find out. The earth
didn't just swallow them. Final
report from each team placed
them well within the city. It's
been ten days since the last contact.
Probe every inch of the
place."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>"But be careful. We can't afford
to lose any more men!
Roger!"</p>

<p>"Roger!"</p>

<p>There was only one way now&mdash;ahead.
It lay clearly marked. The
dim footsteps never strayed or
faltered. Three hours of search
revealed no pitfalls, no dangers,
and no trace of the missing men.
Then night was upon them and
they bedded down gratefully.</p>

<p>"Strange, isn't it? The war
over. The invaders blasted from
the earth. All peril gone. And yet&mdash;men
disappear."</p>

<p>Jarvis stared at the ruins
around them. "I can't take much
more, Mark. Twelve years of war
is enough. Are we never to have
a life&mdash;have our home and
women back, and&mdash;<i>peace</i>?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's been tough. But
think of the women and children
isolated on that sub-satellite. It's
tougher for them&mdash;just waiting."
Stretched on his back, Mark
stared at the cloudless, evening
sky. "But pretty soon we'll get
this planet cleaned up and bring
them in. Christ! Four years without
even seeing a woman. I remember
the last time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay!" Jarvis interrupted impatiently.
"Let's get to sleep."</p>

<p>"Sure, pal. Goodnight."</p>

<p>They fell asleep to dream of
green hills, corn ripening, apples
roasting over an open fire. Peace,
and home, and girls, their firm
legs flashing in the sun.</p>

<p>Soldierlike, Mark was suddenly
awake. He lay without motion,
sensitive to some subtle change
in the surroundings. From the
corner of his eye he could see
Jarvis wrapped in sleep. The silence
seemed eternal.</p>

<p>Then, whisper-soft, came a
murmur, a sound, a voice. A girl's
voice, sighing and singing, from
deep in that devastated spot.</p>

<p>A woman!</p>

<hr />

<p>Instantly, Mark was on his
feet. No need to wake Jarvis.
Plenty of time for Jarvis to find
out&mdash;afterwards. But not yet!
A miracle that a girl had survived
in all that wreckage. But a miracle
he wanted to savour alone!</p>

<p>Ahead, the path turned and
Mark followed it as it went forward
again, downhill, between
the massed walls of rubble. Now
the voice swelled, a melancholy
song. Well, she won't be melancholy
for long, Mark thought. Her
solitary ordeal was over.</p>

<p>"Mark!" Jarvis stood on an
upturned lintel, ten feet above
Mark's head. As Mark jerked to
a stop at the cry, Jarvis jumped
into his path. "You fool! Don't
you know it's a trap?"</p>

<p>"So that's how you want to
play it? The noble friend, protecting
me from myself!" He
slammed a fist into the side of
Jarvis' head. "Well, I won't bite!
She's mine! I found her!"</p>

<hr />

<p>In silence, in the narrow passage
between the rocks, the two fought.
Suddenly, above the sound of fist
on flesh, came the voice of the
girl again, clear, young. "She <i>is</i>
there," thought Jarvis. He could
almost taste her lips on his. The
sensation came as a shock. How
did he know? He'd never had a
woman. That's what came from
listening to the tales of Mark's
exploits with women. Now he had
to have that girl!</p>

<p>The mounting tension of the
fighting snapped something in
Jarvis' seething mind. Danger,
friendship, duty, all meant nothing.
Only one thing mattered.
The girl! Mark had had more
than his share of girls. He, Jarvis,
was the one who should have her!
He'd been deprived of his manhood
long enough! His frenzied
brain hunted a trick to gain his
ends.</p>

<p>Mark's superior strength began
to force Jarvis to give ground.
Then a final blow sent him reeling,
he reached out to break his fall,
his hand closed on a rock. He
threw it. Mark crashed to the
ground, his knee smashed, his leg
useless. Then the tomb stillness
of the dead city took over. The
dust settled slowly. Mark came to
his feet.</p>

<p>Jarvis was gone.</p>

<p>Dragging his useless leg, Mark
forced himself to crawl forward.
Jarvis had to be stopped.</p>

<p>Ahead, a shadow moved, and
for a moment the moon threw the
silhouette of a man against a
cavernous opening in the debris.</p>

<p>"Jarvis!"</p>

<hr />

<p>An electric flash shattered the
darkness. The jagged teeth of the
bolt spit tongues of fire. Cordite
mingled with the raw, nauseant,
revolting smell of scorched flesh
and hair. The figure tottered and
fell into the black mouth of the
cave. Then, as the flame faded, it
lit up small bundles of charred
bones near the fallen body.</p>

<p>There was a whir and a click
of a mechanism. Fifteen feet
away, Mark watched as the arm
of a phonograph rose, moved
slowly back to the starting point.
Then the record began once more
to grind out its death-trap melody.</p>
